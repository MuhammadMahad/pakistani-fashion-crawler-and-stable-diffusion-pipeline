# Pakistani Fashion Clothing sites crawler

This is a site crawler developed using the typescript library [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/docs/introduction) to crawl Pakistani clothing sites to create a dataset of clothing images and their descriptions for fine-tuning a text to image model such as Stable Diffusion.

Extra care was taken to exclude data from:
- vulnerable demographics such as children
- non-clothing items such as fragnances, perfumes etc.
